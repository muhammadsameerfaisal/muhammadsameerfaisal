# 👶 Learn Modern Web Application Development in Baby Steps

Welcome to my very first GitHub repository! 🎉

This repo is part of my learning journey as I dive into **Modern Web Application Development**. I'm documenting everything step-by-step as I learn, build, and grow — just like baby steps 🚼👣. Whether you're a beginner like me or someone looking to refresh their knowledge, you're welcome to follow along!

## 🚀 What I’m Currently Doing

I'm currently learning:

- ✅ **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** fundamentals
- ✅ **Responsive Design** using modern CSS techniques
- ✅ **Git & GitHub** for version control and collaboration
- ✅ **React.js** basics (coming soon!)
- ✅ **VS Code Setup & Best Practices**
- ✅ How to structure a web project professionally

I’m making sure to **understand everything deeply**, not rushing — learning at my own pace but consistently.
